Select the  settings icon to change the export  preferences. File settings •   Grayscale/Color:  Specifies a compression setting that balances file size with image  quality. The smaller the file, the lesser the image quality. •   Tile Size:  Divides the image being compressed into tiles of the given size. (If the image  height or width is not an even multiple of the tile size, partial tiles are used on the  edges.) Image data for each tile is individually compressed and can be individually decompressed. The default value of 256 is recommended. This option is available only  for JPEG 2000 format. •   Format:  Determines how the file is displayed. Available only in JPEG format. It  provides the following options: •   Baseline (Standard):  Displays the image when it has fully downloaded. This  JPEG format is recognizable to most web browsers. •   Baseline (Optimized):  Optimizes color quality of the image and produces  smaller file sizes but is not supported by all web browsers. •   Progressive (3 scans-5 scans):  Downloads the image first as a low-resolution  image, with incremental quality improvements as downloading continues.    Color management RGB/CMYK/Grayscale Specifies the type of color management to be applied to the output file and whether to  embed an ICC profile. Colorspace/Resolution menu next to  Image format , select  PNG . Select the  settings icon to change the export  preferences. PNG format is useful for images that are used on the web. File settings Specifies if the image is interlaced. None creates an image that displays in a web browser only  after downloading is complete. Adam7 creates an image that displays low-resolution versions  in a browser while the full image file is downloading. Adam7 can make downloading time  seem shorter and assures viewers that downloading is in progress; however, it increases file  size. •   None : Compresses the image without a filter. Recommended for indexed-color  and Bitmap-mode images. •   Sub:  Optimizes the compression of images with even horizontal patterns or blends. •   Up:  Optimizes the compression of images with even vertical patterns. •   Average:  Optimizes the compression of low-level noise by averaging the color values  of adjacent pixels. •   Paeth : Optimizes the compression of low-level noise by reassigning adjacent color  values. •   Adaptive:  Applies the filtering algorithm—Sub, Up, Average, or Paeth—best suited for  the image. Select Adaptive if you are unsure of which filter to use.    Color management RGB/Grayscale Specifies the type of color management for the output file and whether to embed an ICC  profile. Colorspace/Resolution menu next to  Image format , select  TIFF . Select the  settings icon to change the export  preferences. TIFF is a flexible bitmap image format supported by virtually all paint, image-editing, and  page-layout applications. Resolution is determined automatically. File settings Specifies a compression format. CCITTG4 is the default and generally produces the smallest  file size. ZIP compression also produces a small file. Some applications cannot open TIFF files that are saved with JPEG or ZIP compression. In  these cases, LZW compression is recommended.

For macOS,  select  File  >  Save . Recover the last saved version On macOS, select the  File  menu >  Revert . About the Autosave feature The Autosave feature guards against losing your work in case of a power failure by  incrementally, and at regular intervals, saving file changes to a specified location. The original  file is not modified. Instead, Acrobat creates an autosave file of changes, which includes all the  changes you made to the open file since the last automatic save. The amount of new  information that the autosave file contains depends on how frequently Acrobat saves the  autosave file. If you set the autosave interval to 15 minutes, you could lose the last 14 minutes  of your work if a problem occurs. Frequent automatic saving prevents loss of data, and is  especially useful if you make extensive changes to a document, such as by adding comments. If you use assistive technology, such as a screen reader, you may want to disable the Autosave  feature so that you don’t lose your place when the file is reloaded. The Autosave feature won’t work in the following cases: •   A document that has its security changed. You must save the document to re-enable  automatic saving of document changes. •   A document displayed in a web browser or incorporated into a container document  that supports  Object Linking  and Embedding (OLE). This document appears outside  the default file system and cannot support automatic saving. Recover lost changes To prevent lost changes after an unexpected interruption, enable the Autosave feature, which  is the default setting. Set up automatic saving 1.   In the Preferences dialog box under Categories, select Documents. 2.   Select Automatically Save Document Changes To Temporary File Every  xx  Minutes (1- 99), and specify the number of minutes.
