Alternatively, you can select  Sign  from the top toolbar. •   Password Protect  the PDF file.

When the signer adds his or her signature in the signature field and then clicks  the  Click to sign  button, the agreement is sent to the next signer with a link to sign, and so  on. Once the agreement is signed by all the signers, everyone gets a copy of the signed  agreement. Note:  Signers are not required to sign up or purchase any Adobe product to sign agreements.  They can sign agreements using a web browser, mobile device, or Acrobat / Acrobat Reader  desktop application. •   Select  Add access password  if you require recipients to enter a password to  open and view the signed PDF file. Adobe Acrobat supports a  range of solutions  for electronic and  digital signatures . These  solutions include certificate signatures that let you sign PDF files with a certificate-based  digital ID. Certificate signatures are also known as digital signatures. Acrobat lets you create  your certificate ID. However, the common approach is to work with a certificate ID from a  trusted third-party certificate authority. Additional signing options in Acrobat include  integration with  Adobe Acrobat Sign . Why use certificate signatures? Many business transactions, including financial, legal, and other regulated transactions,  require high assurance when signing documents. When documents are distributed  electronically, it's important that recipients can: •   Verify document authenticity—confirming the identity of each person who signed the  document •   Verify document integrity—confirming that the document has not been altered in  transit Certificate-based signatures provide both of these security services. Many businesses and  governments have chosen to set up a certificate-based digital signature infrastructure within  their organization. They use third-party certificate authorities to provide independent identity  validation. Examples include: For instance, companies in the European Union who need to comply with advanced or  qualified electronic signature requirements in  eIDAS e-signature regulation  or the  ETSI PAdES  standard  (PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures). What can I do with certificate IDs? Once certificate-based digital IDs have been provided to end users, they can  use  Acrobat  or  Acrobat Reader  software to sign PDF files and validate files they receive from  others. •   Sign PDF files using certificate IDs •   Certify a document with a visible or hidden signature so that recipients can verify  authenticity with or without seeing a visible signature on the page •   Automatically embed certificate data to support long-term validation Validate documents •   Validate document integrity by tracking all previously signed versions of a document  to verify changes made during the document’s lifecycle •   Certify a document while leaving portions of it available for  form filling , signatures, or  comments •   Use Acrobat Pro software to enable users of Reader 9 or later to sign with certificate  IDs •   Use Acrobat Standard or Pro to encrypt a PDF document with a certificate ID to restrict  usage such as printing, editing, or copying    What if my organization isn’t prepared to set up certificate- based signatures? Consider signing up for  Adobe Acrobat Sign  online, the leader in  e-signatures  and web  contracting. With Acrobat Sign, you can get PDF, Microsoft Word, and other documents sent,  signed, and filed instantly. And best of all, Adobe hosts it securely, so your IT department  doesn’t have to do the work of setting up a signature infrastructure. Adobe Approved Trust List (AATL) : The Adobe Approved Trust List is a program that allows  millions of users worldwide to create digital signatures that are trusted whenever the signed  document is opened in Acrobat or Reader software. Check out the  current members . Certified Document Services : Certified Document Services (CDS) was the predecessor to the  AATL. Content Security Library : Extensive documentation on Adobe certificate signature  administration. A  certificate-based signature , like a conventional handwritten signature, identifies the person  signing a document. Unlike a handwritten signature, a certificate-based signature is difficult to  forge because it contains encrypted information that is unique to the signer. It can be easily  verified and informs recipients whether the document was modified after the signer initially  signed it. To sign a document with a certificate-based signature, you must obtain a digital ID or create a  self-signed digital ID in Acrobat or  Acrobat Reader . The digital ID contains a private key and a  certificate with a public key, and more. The private key is used to create the certificate-based signature. The certificate is a credential that is automatically applied to the signed document.  The signature is verified when recipients open the document. When you apply a certificate-based signature, Acrobat uses a hashing algorithm to generate a  message digest, which it encrypts using your private key. Acrobat embeds the encrypted  message digest in the PDF, certificate details, signature image, and a document version when  signed. Certificate-based signature in a PDF form     Steps to add a certificate-based signature to a PDF 1.   Open a PDF in Acrobat and choose  All Tools  >  more  >  Use a certificate  in the Alternatively, from Acrobat Home, select  See all tools . In the Protect section,  select  Use a certificate , and then  select a file  you want to certify. 2.

Your document is now certified. Certifying and signing documents The  Use a certificate  tool lets you apply two types of certificate-based signatures. You  can  Certify  a document, attest to its content or approve a document with the  Digitally  sign  option. When you  Digitally sign  with a certificate, the signature is considered an approval signature. Certify (visible or invisible signatures) Certify  options provide a higher level of document control than  Digitally sign . For documents  that require certification, you must certify the documents before others sign them. If a  document has already been signed, the Certify options are disabled. When you certify a  document, you can control the types of changes other people can make. You can certify with  or without displaying a signature. Signatures made with the  Certify  or  Digitally sign  options   comply with data protection  standards specified by the  European Telecommunications Standards Institute  (ETSI). In  addition, both signature types comply with the PDF Advanced Electronic Signature (PAdES)  standard. Acrobat and Acrobat Reader provide an option to change the default signing format  to a CAdES format. This option is compliant with Part 3 of the PAdES standard. The timestamp  capability and native support for long-term validation of signatures (introduced in Acrobat  9.1) is in compliance with Part 4 of the PAdES standard. The default signing format, when set  up accordingly, is compliant with Part 2 of the PAdES standard. You can change the default  signing method or format, in the Signatures panel of the Preferences dialog box. Under  Creation & Appearance, click More. Setting up certificate-based signatures Some situations require using particular digital IDs for signing. For example, a corporation or  government agency can require individuals to use only digital IDs issued by that agency to  sign official documents.  Inquire about the digital signature policies  of your organization to  determine the appropriate source of your digital ID. •   Get a digital ID from your own organization, buy a digital ID (see the Adobe website  for security partners), or create a self-signed one. See  Create a self-signed digital ID .  You can’t apply a certificate-based signature without a digital id. •   Create an appearance for your certificate-based signature. (See  Create the signature  appearance. ) •   Use   the  Preview Document  mode to suppress any dynamic content that can alter the  appearance of the document and mislead you into signing an unsuitable document.  For information about using the  Preview Document  mode, see  Sign in Preview  Document mode . Seed values  offer additional control to document authors by letting them specify which  choices signers can make when signing a document. By applying seed values to signature  fields in unsigned PDFs, authors can customize options and automate tasks. They can also  specify signature requirements for items such as certificates and timestamp servers. For more  information about customizing signatures using seed values, see the  Digital Signature Guide . Create the appearance of a certificate-based signature certificate-based signature, scan your signature, and save it as an image file. Place  the image in a document by itself, and convert the document to PDF. Imported Graphic   Displays an image with your certificate-based signature. Select this option to include  an image of your handwritten signature. To import the image file, select File, select  Browse and then select the image file. You can have multiple digital IDs that you use for different purposes, particularly if you sign  documents in different roles or using different certification methods.  Digital IDs  are usually  password protected. They can be stored on your computer in PKCS #12 file format.  Digital  IDs  can also be stored on a smart card, hardware token, or in the Windows certificate store.  Roaming IDs can be stored on a server. Acrobat includes a default signature handler that can  access digital IDs from various locations. Register the digital ID in Acrobat for it to be available  for use. Store certificates on directory servers Note:  See also  Export security settings .      Add a timestamp to certificate-based signatures You can include the date and time you signed the document as part of your certificate-based  signature. Timestamps are easier to verify when they are associated with a trusted timestamp  authority certificate. A timestamp helps to establish when you signed the document and  reduces the chances of an invalid signature. You can obtain a timestamp from a third-party  timestamp authority or the certificate authority that issued your digital ID.",
