You might encounter formatting challenges that require manual adjustments. Acrobat's  image-editing capabilities are limited, and using high-resolution images can lead to  performance issues due to larger file sizes. To address this, improve images using other tools  before adding them to PDF documents. If the original font isn't available, font substitutions may occur, altering the text's appearance.  To maintain consistency across devices, we suggest you use the available fonts or embed  them within the PDF. You can also enhance document accessibility using Acrobat's features, such as adding  alternative text for images and proper content tagging. Refer to the following topics to learn how to add, resize, move, or replace images and objects  in a PDF using Acrobat. Add images in a PDF 1.   Open the PDF in Acrobat.
