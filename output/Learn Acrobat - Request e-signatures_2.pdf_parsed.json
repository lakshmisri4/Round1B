      "content": "To verify authenticity, the validator checks if the signer's certificate or its parent certificates are  trusted. The validity of the signing certificate is also checked based on the user's Acrobat or  Acrobat Reader settings. You can set verification preferences in advance so digital signatures are valid when you open  a PDF and verification details appear with the signature. When Digital Signatures are  validated, an icon appears in the document message bar to indicate the signature status. In Acrobat or Acrobat Reader, the signature of a certified or signed document is valid if you  and the signer have a trust relationship. The trust level of the certificate indicates the actions  for which you trust the signer. •   Certified documents : It t rusts documents in which the author has certified the  document with a signature. You trust the signer for certifying documents, and  you accept actions that the certified document takes.  When the 'Certified documents' option is selected, the following options are  available: When document integrity is critical for your signature workflow, you can enable 'View  documents in Preview mode', and then sign the document. This feature analyzes the  document for content that may alter the look and feel of the document and suppresses such  content to allow you to view and sign the document in a static and secure state. A certifying signature can only be applied if the PDF has no other signatures. These signatures 1.   Open the PDF for which you want to validate all digital signatures. Whenever a certificate is used to sign a document, a signed version of the PDF is created and  saved along with the original PDF. The saved versions are in an append-only format, meaning  the original PDF can’t be modified. The Signatures panel provides access to all digital  signatures and their corresponding versions. Sign component PDFs and PDF Portfolios You can sign component PDFs within a PDF Portfolio, or sign the PDF Portfolio as a whole.  Signing a component PDF locks the PDF for editing and secures its content. After signing all  the component PDFs, you can sign the entire PDF Portfolio to finalize it. Alternatively, you can  sign the PDF Portfolio as a whole to lock the content of all component PDFs simultaneously. •   To sign a component PDF, see  Signing PDFs . The signed PDF is automatically saved to  the PDF Portfolio. •   To sign a PDF Portfolio as a whole, sign the cover sheet (View > Portfolio > Cover  Sheet). Once you sign the PDF Portfolio as a whole, you can’t add signatures to the  component documents. However, you can add more signatures to the cover sheet. Digitally sign on attachments to component PDFs 3.   To view signatures on the PDF Portfolio, navigate to the cover sheet to view the document message bar and signatures pane.     View signed and certified PDF Portfolios A properly signed or certified PDF Portfolio has one or more signatures that approve or certify  the PDF Portfolio. The most significant signature appears in a Signature badge in the toolbar.  Details of all signatures appear on the cover sheet. •   To view the name of the organization or person that signed the PDF Portfolio, hover  the pointer over the Signature Badge. If the PDF Portfolio approval or certification is invalid or has a problem, the Signature  Badge shows a warning icon. To view an explanation of the problem, hover the pointer over  a Signature Badge with a warning icon. Different warning icons appear for different situations. XML data signatures conform to the W3C XML-Signature standard. Like PDF digital  signatures, XML digital signatures ensure integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation in  documents. However, PDF signatures have multiple data verification states. Some states are called when a  user alters the PDF-signed content. In contrast, XML signatures only have two data verification  states, valid and invalid. The invalid state is called when a user alters the XML-signed content. Long-term signature validation allows you to verify the signature's validity long after the  document was signed. To achieve this, all the necessary elements for signature validation  must be embedded in the signed PDF. These elements can be embedded during the  document signing process or added afterward. If certain information is not included in the PDF, the signature can only be validated for a  limited time because certificates related to the signature eventually expire or are revoked.  When a certificate expires, the issuing authority is no longer responsible for providing  revocation status, rendering the signature unverifiable. 3.   Sign the PDF. then right-click the signature in the PDF. Information and methods used to include this long-term validation (LTV) information in the  PDF comply with Part 4 of the ETSI 102 778 PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures (PAdES)  standard.",

The policies are stored on the ALCRM server. You require server  access to use them. ALCRM servers embed user access information in documents. Therefore, specify document  recipients in ALCRM policies. Alternatively, let the ALCRM server retrieve the list of recipients  from LDAP directories. Use ALCRM servers to set permissions for separate document tasks, for example opening,  editing, and printing. You can also define document auditing policies on ALCRM servers. 1.

Navigate to the hamburger menu     (Windows) or the  Acrobat  menu (macOS) Certify a PDF Certifying a PDF means approving its contents and specifying what changes are allowed for  the document to remain certified. For example, a government agency creates a form with  signature fields and certifies it, allowing users to only change form fields and sign the  document. Removing pages or adding comments will result in losing the certified status. Acrobat allows users to add a document timestamp to a PDF without needing an identity- based signature. To timestamp a PDF, a timestamp server is needed. See how to  configure a  timestamp server .  A timestamp guarantees the authenticity and existence of a document at a specific time and  complies with ETSI 102 778 PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures (PAdES) standard. 1.   Open the PDF in a separate window. Acrobat and Acrobat Reader support XML data signatures that are used to sign data in XML  Forms Architectures (XFA) forms. The form author provides XML signing, validating, or  clearing instructions for form events, such as button click, file save, or submit. Acrobat and Acrobat Reader can embed the necessary elements if available, and the PDF  creator must enable usage rights for Acrobat Reader users by going to the hamburger  menu     (Windows) or the  Acrobat  menu (macOS) >  Save as other  >  Acrobat Reader  extended PDF .

      "content": "What is a digital signature? Digital signatures are a secure and efficient way to electronically sign and authenticate  documents, ensuring their authenticity and integrity. By using digital signatures, you can sign  documents quickly and easily, and be confident that they can’t be tampered with or forged. Why validate a digital signature? When you receive a signed document, you may want to validate its signature to verify the  signer and the signed content. Depending on how you’ve configured your application,  validation may occur automatically. Signature validity is determined by checking the  authenticity of the signature’s digital ID certificate status and document integrity. To verify document integrity, the validator checks if the signed content was altered after  signing. If changes were made, the verification ensures that the signer allowed the changes. Set preferences for validating digital signatures 3.   From the  Verification  box in the  Digital Signatures  panel, select  More... 4.   In the 'Signature Verification Preferences' dialog that opens, you can control the •   Set verification behavior:  The options specify methods that determine  which plug-in to choose when verifying a signature. The appropriate plug-in  is often selected automatically. Contact your system administrator about  specific plug-in requirements for validating signatures. signatures is ignored. The revocation status is always checked to certify  signatures. •   Set verification for time : You can select the appropriate options under  'Verification time' to check the time at which the signature was created, to  check the timestamp embedded in the signature, or to check the current  time. •   Signed documents or data : It a cknowledges the identity of the signer. Note:  You can right-click a signature field in the  Signatures  panel to do most signature- related tasks, including adding, clearing, and validating signatures. In some cases, however,  the signature field becomes locked after you sign it.    Sign in preview mode for document integrity can be visible or invisible, and a blue ribbon icon    in the Signatures panel confirms a valid  certifying signature. Adding a certifying digital signature requires a digital ID. Validate a digital signature If the signature status is unknown or unverified, manually validate it to identify the issue and  find a potential solution. In case the signature status is invalid, you must contact the signer to  resolve the issue. Validate all digital signatures 3.   From the  All tools  pane, select  Use a certificate  >  Validate all signature. 4.   Select  OK  in the confirmation dialog box. Once all the signatures are validated. You XML data signatures Establish long-term signature validation The necessary elements for signature validity include the signing certificate chain, certificate  revocation status, and possibly a timestamp. If these elements are embedded during signing,  the signature can be validated without requiring external resources. Note:  Embedding timestamp information requires an appropriately configured timestamp  server. In addition, the signature validation time must be set to Secure Time by navigating  to  Preferences  >  Security  >  Advanced Preferences  >  Verification  tab. CDS certificates can add verification information, such as revocation and timestamp into the  document without requiring any configuration from the signer. However, the signer must be  online to fetch the appropriate information. Add verification information at signing To add verification information while signing: Add verification information after signing In certain workflows, signature validation information may be unavailable during the signing  but can be obtained later. For instance, a company official may sign a contract on a laptop  while traveling without internet access. When internet access is later available, anyone  validating the signature can add timestamping and revocation information to the PDF.  Subsequent signature validations can also make use of this information. To add verification information after signing: 2.   Select  Add Verification Information .
