Note:  For Photoshop, if the image is in a format supported by Photoshop 6.0 or later, your  edited image is saved back into the PDF. However, if the image is in an unsupported format,  Photoshop handles the image as a generic PDF image. The edited image is saved to disk  instead of the PDF.     Export PDF images to another format Note:  The creator of a PDF document can set the security to prevent the extraction of pages.  To view the security settings for a document, choose  Document properties  from the  hamburger menu   (Windows) or  File  menu in macOS and then select the  Security  tab in  the dialog. Edit Scanned PDFs Editing a scanned PDF can be complicated if it includes low-quality text or images, non- editable text, line breaks, or complex formatting. Other inhibiting factors include compatibility  issues, security restrictions, and large file sizes, which are more prevalent in PDFs created from  scanned images. To streamline the process, consider the following best practices and guidelines before editing  a scanned document: Check the accuracy of optical character recognition (OCR) output . When you open a  scanned document, Acrobat  automatically runs OCR  in the background to make the  document editable. Before editing, review the document to ensure that the content is  accurate and complete. If necessary, rescan the document using the  Scan & OCR  >  Recognize  Text  tool to improve the output. Enhance image quality . If the scanned PDF contains low-quality images, use the  Enhance  scanned file  or  Enhance camera image  feature to improve the quality of images before  attempting to edit the document. For more information, see  Scan documents to PDF . Use the correct font and formatting . When editing the document, ensure that the font and  formatting of the edited text match the original document as closely as possible. If you don't  have the desired fonts on your computer, see  Add fonts to your computer . Remove security restrictions . If the scanned PDF has security restrictions that prevent editing,  remove these restrictions before attempting to edit the document. To know how to remove  security from a PDF, see  Unlock a PDF . Avoid editing complex elements . If the scanned PDF contains tables, graphs, or images,  avoid unnecessary edits that could alter the layout or formatting of these elements. Check for compatibility issues . Ensure that the version of Adobe Acrobat you're using is  compatible with the scanned PDF. If you encounter compatibility issues, try updating Adobe  Acrobat. For more information, see  System requirements . Save a backup copy . Always save a backup copy of the original scanned PDF before making  any edits. Revert to the original document if any issues arise during the editing process. Recognize text on scanned PDF You can use the Scan & OCR tool to recognize text, change OCR language, and make all  pages editable in one go. To do so: 1.   Open the scanned file, and then from the top banner that appears, select  Get  started . It opens the Scan & OCR tool options in the left panel Edit a scanned document 1.   Open the scanned PDF file in Acrobat. the original font in your scanned PDF. Enhance scanned file or camera images for  clear PDFs You can capture document photos with your smartphone and use the  Enhance camera  image  feature to create polished, clear, and compact PDFs without needing a standard  scanner. This feature addresses common issues in mobile-captured images, such as incorrect  perspectives, areas beyond boundaries, shadows, and inconsistent lighting. While it may not  eliminate all problems, it significantly improves the overall quality of your resulting PDF. 1.   Open the photograph or image of the document in Acrobat. 2.   From the  All tools  menu, select  Scan & OCR .",
