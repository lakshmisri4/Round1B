Create PDFs by printing to file In many authoring applications, you can use the Print command with the Adobe PDF printer to  convert your file to PDF. Your source document is converted to PostScript and fed directly to  Distiller for conversion to PDF, without manually starting Distiller. The current Distiller  preference settings and Adobe PDF settings are used to convert the file. If you’re working with  nonstandard page sizes, create a custom page size. (Windows) For Microsoft Office documents, the  Adobe PDF  printer does not include some of  the features that are available from PDFMaker. For example, you cannot create bookmarks and  hyperlinks using the  Adobe PDF  printer. If you’re creating a PDF from a  Microsoft  Office  document and you want to use these features, use PDFMaker. The  Adobe PDF  printer creates untagged PDFs. A tagged structure is required for reflowing  content to a handheld device and is preferable for producing reliable results with a screen  reader. Create a PDF using the Print command (Windows) 1.   Open the file in its authoring application, and choose File > Print. 2.   Choose  Adobe PDF  from the printers menu. 3.   Click the Properties (or Preferences) button to customize the  Adobe PDF  printer setting. (In some applications, you may need to click Setup in the Print dialog box to  open the list of printers, and then click Properties or Preferences.)

Choose  Save As Adobe PDF  from the PDF menu at the bottom of the dialog box. 3.   For  Adobe PDF  Settings, choose one of the default settings, or customize the settings For most users, the default  Adobe PDF  conversion settings are adequate. 4.   For After PDF Creation, specify whether to open the PDF. 6.   Select a name and location for your PDF, and click Save. Note:  By default, your PDF is saved with the same filename and a .pdf extension. Adobe PDF printing preferences (Windows) Printing preferences apply to all applications that use the  Adobe PDF  printer, unless you change  the settings in an authoring application by using the  Page Setup , Document Setup , or Print  menu. The dialog box for setting printing preferences is named  Adobe PDFPrinting Preferences ,  Adobe PDF Printing Defaults, or  Adobe PDFDocument Properties , depending on how you  access it.
