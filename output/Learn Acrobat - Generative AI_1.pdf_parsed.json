      "content": "Do not use generative AI features to seek legal, medical, financial, or other kinds of  professional advice or any opinions, judgments, or recommendations without conducting  your own independent consultation or research. Generative AI features cannot replace  advice provided by a qualified professional and do not form any such relationship (for  example, an attorney-client relationship). When the AI Assistant analyzes a document, it identifies sentences most likely to support the  answer to your question. Attribution can take the form of clickable citations or other helpful cues indicating where generated information came from. However, because the AI Assistant is  powered by generative AI models, and the technology is still evolving and not perfect, not all  answers are helpful or accurate. As a result, the AI Assistant may not find and display answers  to your questions — even when the information is in your document. And rarely, the AI  Assistant may provide incorrect attributions. For example, you may receive a clickable citation  or cue that takes you to an unrelated section instead of providing helpful information on  where the answer came from in the document. Please double-check all AI-generated  responses. Please note that in our current version, if the language of the question and response is  different than the language of your document, AI Assistant won't provide any attribution. In  such scenarios, you can try asking questions in the language of the document to receive  clickable citations in the response.
